Shurima! Your emperor has returned!
Shurima will once again stretch to the horizon.
Shurima is where all paths converge.
The world is a desert. I am the oasis.
Eventually, the sands claim us all.
I will open their eyes.
The unworthy have no place in history.
See what I see.
Ancient power courses through me.
Fate is in our hands.
They dare defy Shurima?
With a word, I end you.
Challenge Shurima, challenge fate.
Never cross an emperor.
Shurima will brook no offense.
Behold the desert's wrath.
Mine is the will of Shurima.
They have overstepped.
Give yourselves to Shurima.
You dare oppose me?
Soon, none will question us.
Who denies our right to rule?
No dragon can defeat us!
I have no fear of dragons.
Even dragons look up to the sun.
This spider will be trampled in our march.
You may be large, Vilemaw, but you remain an insect to me.
It is you who are in my web, spider.
No beast will stop us!
We will overcome this monster!
What is a baron to an emperor?
Emperors have no need of barons.
The power of the sun lives in Shurima.
You need not follow, but you must witness.
I will return Shurima to greatness.
Those who follow me follow destiny.
My empire lives in every grain of sand.
Shurima's legacy will endure.
We are the authors of history.
I am Shurima's dawn.
Everyone will know the name Shurima.
No sacrifice is too great.
We are made by our choices.
We will unearth what has been lost.
None know the will of the desert better than I.
We walk a path of radiance.
The Ascended shall guide humanity to greatness.
This slumbering world must awaken.
Shurima lives in me.
Believe in our future.
Loyalty will be rewarded.
A ruler must choose his hour.
There is no future without Shurima.
Join me, and be elevated.
All eyes look to us.
So, a pigeon walks into a bar...
For emperors, it's all about how you carry yourself.
There is only Shurima. All else is but a mirage.
What is the desert, but the ashes of my enemies?
When every trace of you is lost, I will remain.
You must learn respect, Sivir.
Accept your destiny, Sivir.
Rise with Shurima, Sivir, or fall beneath it.
Renekton, once a noble warrior, now naught but a mad beast.
You have forgotten yourself, Renekton.
You are but a grain of sand, Xerath.
Emperors have no rivals, Xerath. Only liabilities.
Xerath, it is time your spark went out.
You have already failed, Xerath. You must now accept it.
Traitor, I cast you to the winds.
You are but my shadow, Xerath.
Xerath, the time of your judgment has come.
Kill.
Conquer.
Soldiers, onward.
The order is given.
Bury them.
My decree is made.
Trust in me.
Shurima is eternal.
Glory to Shurima.
My soldiers march on.
I am Ascended.
My city lives on.
You cannot topple Shurima.
Rise again!
Return from the sands.
Shurima is never lost.
Return.
Arise.
Serve me.
This now serves Shurima.
Recognize your emperor.
This is Shuriman land.
I claim this for Shurima.
Return!
Arise!
I am Shurima's vision.
The light of Shurima.
Trust in my vision.
The bounty of Shurima still flows.
I will shift as the sands.
May the sands of Shurima always be under our feet.
I will be reborn.
Emperors never die.
An idol of greatness.
Shuriman sands flow ever in our favour.
Time itself serves Shurima.
Your emperor shall return.
Shurima...
How...?
I will reclaim my stolen legacy.
Here, we shall decide the future of Shurima!
The future will be written by the Ascended!
Today, you will see the power of Ascension!
Like the sun, Shurima always rises!
It has been a long wait, Nasus, but it will be worth it.
Let us return to our rightful place, Nasus.
It is our right to rule, Sivir.
Together, we shall strive toward victory, Sivir.
I am testament to the glory of Shurima!
It is my time. Put your faith in me.
I will guide us to glory.
You need not follow me... but you cannot stop me.
It is your turn to carry our great legacy.
Teach them to respect Ascension.
This is but one step on a long and glorious path.
At last, Shurima will reach its destiny!
Shurima will know only victory.
None shall ever question the power of Shurima!
Shurima will once again stretch to the horizon.

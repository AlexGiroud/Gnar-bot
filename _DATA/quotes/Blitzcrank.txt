Fired up and ready to serve.
Metal is harder than flesh.
Bone is a poor alternative.
Look. You're leaking.
Your steam is escaping.
Quake in fear, fleshling.
Exterminate. Exterminate.
Precisely.
I remain focused.
The magic calls to me.
A rolling golem gathers no rust.
As long as it takes.
The time of man has come to an end.
I put the 'go' in 'golem'. That was humor. Other golems find that to be appropriately funny.

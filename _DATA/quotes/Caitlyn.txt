I'm on the case.
Got them in my sights.
Meet the long gun of the law.
Boom. Headshot.
So many bad guys, so little time.
Who doesn't like being under the gun?
Up for a showdown?
Sorry boys, I keep the fuzzy cuffs at home.
Hot on the trail.
I love a good chase.
Don't be caught flat footing.
I have the tools for the job.
Wanna see a hat trick?
Let's investigate.
Time for a shakedown.
Me, miss? Not by a long shot.
Right.
Want another shot? I wouldn't want to leave things up in the air.
Would you prefer the good cop, or the bad cop?
A sniper's greatest tool is precision... and good equipment.
The whole is greater than the sum of its... parts.
Calibrating.
Steady...
In my sights.
Nowhere to hide.
Target marked.

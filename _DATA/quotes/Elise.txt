Only the spider is safe in her web.
I know what lurks in the shadows.
I know the true path.
There's nothing to fear.
Pull the strings. Watch them dance.
We must all make sacrifices.
I can show them the way to divinity.
My true beauty is beneath the skin.
They need... guidance.
Every web, a masterpiece.
I have... refined tastes.
<span class=
Ah, the tangled webs we weave.
Dangling by a thread.
Weak willed fools!
It will all be over soon.
I hear a man likes a lady with legs.
Hmm, why so tense? Relax.
Come closer, I don't <span style=
The spider, <span style=
I can feel their fear.
Patience...
Strand by silken strand.
How fast can they run on two legs?
I lurk in every shadow.
Now I thrive!
Skitter along, my pets.
Nothing escapes my web.
Partake of my poison.
Tangled in my web.
Sate my hunger!
They'll make quite the mess.
Simply delicious.
Nothing but buzzing flies.
The pain will be fleeting.
Ha! It's all in the body language.
Ha! Ladies wish they had legs like me.
The spider, <span style=
Surprise! I <span style=
Your power is not worth the price, Elise.
Your humanity traded away, and for what?
<span class=
We thank you for your gifts, Elise!

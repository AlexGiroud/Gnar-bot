Time for a true display of skill!
It's all skill!
I'll handle it!
No problem!
Time to strike!
Sounds dangerous... I'm in!
Time to get our hands dirty.
Over here!
Let's go!
Know your environment.
This way!
Careful!
Got it!
Agreed!
No time to waste!
Who needs a map?!
You belong in a museum!
Noxians... I hate those guys...
Target acquired.
They're living in the past.
Cannons primed.
Can't fight the inevitable.
They don't know what they're up against.
Scanning for real threats... none detected.
Their weapons are a little outdated.
Time's running out.
All charged up.
Weapons hot!
No turning back now.
All systems charged.
Sounds apocalyptic, I'm in.
I'm centuries ahead of them.
What is their position?
Give me the coordinates.
Grim dark future huh? Too easy.
I'll make my own future.
There's no match for...

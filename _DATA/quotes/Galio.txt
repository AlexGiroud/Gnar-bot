A guardian is always prepared.
Assault from above!
The will of Demacia.
Preemptive strike.
With great force.
Justice will be done.
So be it.
In flight.
An honor to serve.
I will protect..
On the approach.
Moving out.
Remain alert.
By your command.
Without fear.
I will not fail.
You should come back with more bad guys.
Two birds with one stone? Have you met my parents?
Their time has come!
The gate beckons.
Inevitable demise.
Death is no release.
Join the hereafter.
No escape.
Fear my gaze.
Eternal sleep... not quite.
All have their place.
Oblivion? No.
To seal the beyond.
Restless souls stir.
I serve between worlds.
A fateful journey.
Do not trust the dead.
I guard between life and death. Killing me only sends me home.
If you kill me who will mind the gate? Will it be you?
I prepare for what waits beyond. Shall I show you?
Dead men tell no tales? I wish... they're never quiet.
I always let door to door merchants in. I just don't let them out.
Knock knock. Who's there? An endless legion of souls!

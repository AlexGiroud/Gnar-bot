Behold the might of the Shadow Isles.
Break their ranks.
Embrace death.
Trample their bones.
The living will fall.
Never relent.
Crush them underfoot.
The shadow approaches.
War is eternal.
Ride out.
Their souls beg for release.
Send me to battle.
The grave calls.
I do not rest.
I am beyond death.
Suffering is magic.
Another blue ribbon for Hecarim.
Your life is a burden. I bring you freedom!
You won't live to see your world destroyed.
Despair!
Face death!
Torment!
Cower!
Run!
Terror!
Break their ranks.
Embrace death.
Trample their bones.
The living will fall.
Never relent.
Crush them underfoot.
The shadow approaches.
War is eternal.
Ride out.
Their souls beg for release.
Send me to battle.
The grave calls.
Life is fleeting.
I do not rest.
I am beyond death.
Suffering is magic.
Another blue ribbon for Hecarim.
Your life is a burden. I bring you freedom!
You won't live to see your world destroyed.
Despair!
Face death!
Torment!
Cower!
Run!
Terror!
Plays a guitar solo.
Remember who you once were, Hecarim!

I aid you because I must, Hecarim.
 Lead our charge, Hecarim, and may the living tremble!
They will fear the thundering hooves of the dead!

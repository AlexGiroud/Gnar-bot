Death to all betrayers.
Turncoats, oath breakers and betrayers... we hate them all.
The blood of kith and kin stains their hands.
There can be no justice. Only revenge.
Familiar suffering... we know this place.
The dead feel not the cold.
Traitors!
It is time.
You will never suffer enough!
We see their guilt.
Bleed, betrayer!
You are condemned.
You have earned your fate.
So your treachery ends.
Pluck them from their reverie.
Know your folly.
Your death has been ordained.
We will claim you.
Be judged.
Our spear shall find you.
We have no mercy.
They disgust us.
None can evade us.
Retribution approaches.
Accept no contrition.
We shall pierce their treasonous hearts.
Abomination!
The Baron must die.
You shall aid our cause, dragon.
Serpents are creatures of betrayal.
Bring the dragon down.
We are vengeance.
All things have consequence.
One thought drives us.
Promises must be kept.
We are set in motion.
We can be anywhere.
What is started will be finished.
Our task is unending.
Kalista... yes, that was our name.
Our hatred burns cold.
We never rest.
Know our pain, know our truth.
The wounds of betrayal never heal.
We remain true to our purpose.
We go where we are needed.
Nothing shall turn us from our path.
We are called elsewhere.
We - I - must remember.
Trust... is a weapon.
Nothing is more heinous than treachery.
We began as one.
Back to back, we stood.
We had a name once.
We trusted.
Why?
This land was so beautiful... 
There will be no escape - I said no escape!
We act as one - two - three - cease this!
Nothing shall distract - hey, hey hey!
We are not finished with you!
Return our spear!
You will be taken!
You could never bear our burden!
Let's see how many spears you can endure!
Soft are the targets of our spears today!
Serpent, we sense your disgrace.
You too shall have a blade in your back, snake.
No such snake shall go unpunished.
We taste your anger, Graves.
Graves, you have only to speak our name.
Give in to your hate, Graves.
You toy with powers you do not comprehend, Deathsinger.
Death is not solely your purview, Karthus.
Only a fool would embrace death, Karthus.
We see the course of your deception, Ice Witch.
Your duplicity ends here, Lissandra.
We see through you, Ice Witch.
Twisted Fate, your hour approaches.
You are a vile betrayer, Cardmaster!
There is no loss greater than betrayal, Varus.
Your retribution lacks aim, Varus.
You have pledged yourself to a false agent, Varus.
Weep!
Die!
Suffer!
Fall!
Find them!
Be our eyes!
Go!
Seek!
No respite!
Now!
Crawl!
To our side.
It is your turn.
Hurt them.
Claim your due.
Its edge is keen as the spear's tip.
So shall others feel the bite of steel.
This sharpens our focus.
Our spears heed no armor.
Nothing can protect them from our retribution.
We will pierce their souls.
Our need goes deeper than blood.
As they weaken, so shall we grow stronger.
Feed our cause.
Foul sorcery shall not deter us.
We will not be impeded.
We will not be at the mercy of those who hide behind magic.
Once, he was a noble king, until grief overcame his reason.
In the end, it was not his blade that stole our lives.
As once it symbolized hope, so now shall it incite despair!
We have heard your plea.
Our retribution shall be swift.
Blood seals our pact.
Our fates are intertwined.
Do not forsake us, as he did.
The oath has been taken.
Vengeance is at hand.
The pact is made.
We are one now.
You shall be avenged.
Your killers will be punished.
We shall bring your killers to their knees.
Our will is one.
Yes! Punish the betrayers!
Our instincts align.
You strengthen us.
You share in our success.
We will remember your loyalty.
It is not yet your time.
They shall not have you.
Our bond preserves you.
The pact remains unfulfilled!
We are unbound!
Bind us!
We trust nothing to chance.
We are always aware.
We watch.
Know that we shall return.
We must attend to other matters.
Our spears are precise.
We never miss.
Our aim does not falter.
Thus is our vengeance exacted.
Your pain is no more than a trifle to us.
Feel our hate.

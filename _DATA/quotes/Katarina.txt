Violence solves everything!
My pleasure.
Let the bloodshed begin!
Let's dance!
Blood for Noxus!
Without mercy.
Is that fear I smell?
I can't wait.
Ready for trouble?
I've made my choice.
Intriguing.
Keep friends close and enemies guessing.
Never play fair.
To the point.
Why? Because I can.
No going back.
I like it.
Only fools hesitate.
Better dead than dull.
Come on, live a little... while you can!
If you run, you won't see me stab you!
Next time... run!
Unmatched.
The dance of blades.
Too easy.
My pleasure.

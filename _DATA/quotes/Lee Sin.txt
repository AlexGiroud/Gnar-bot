Your will, my hands.
Strike firmly!
Their heartbeats quicken.
Worry not.
I'll see this through.
Act free of doubt.
Quiet steps.
Extend your senses.
Where am I needed?
Find your center.
I will atone.
Master yourself, master the enemy.
Waste not a minute!
We do what we must.
Force is meaningless without skill.
You have not earned victory this day.
Blindness is no impairment against a smelly enemy.

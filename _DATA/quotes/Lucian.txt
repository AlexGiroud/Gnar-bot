Everybody dies. Some just need a little help.
Rest in peace.
They never get tired of dying.
Bullseyes.
Stay dead.
Purity and peace.
By all means, stand and fight.
This is</b> mercy.
We're gonna need more coffins.
Just another corpse.
Tough talk for worm food.
Don't duck on my account.
Trick shot? The trick is not</b> to get shot.
Rise again, I dare you.
H'yeah, I've got a cure for that.
Keep moving on.
Everybody deserves a second shot.
Death should be the end.
There's a chill in the air.
Nothing colder than death.
I'll sleep when they're dead.
The past is just a ghost.
Something is rotten here.
Go ahead, scare me.
You don't have the heart for this.
Don't look so grim.
Some call it magic. I call it good aim.
Smile? Alright.
This is</b> my happy face. See?
Heheh, and they say I have a grim sense of humor.
No, really... I am</b> smilin'.
I'll have no trouble killing you, and less trouble killing you again!
Death is a mercy, and I have enough mercy to go around.
Death at the door? Hmph, no. I am the one who knocks.
You took the better half of me, Thresh. What you left is a dangerous enemy.
It's not that I fear you, Hecarim. I just hate to put a good horse down.
Let's crack you open, Mordekaiser, and see what's inside.
It ends here!
For Senna!
Ashes and dust!
This is over!
Senna...
I failed...
Rest in peace.

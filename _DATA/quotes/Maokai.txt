I do your bidding... for now... 
Begone vile magics!
I will punish their imprudence.
Reckless mages.
I will end this misuse of magic.
They will know my remorse.
Do you want to see twisted?
This power... I cannot control!
Torment me no longer!
To rest... if only I could.
This life was not meant to be.
You should not defy nature!
There is no escape.
I once had peace.
Return me to the forest... 
I would end this burden, but it always returns.
Nature is the truest form of balance. Eat and avoid being eaten.
Animals are lazy. We plants produce our own food.
Is this what they call getting stumped? Hahaha!
Nature can be a real mother. Hahaha!

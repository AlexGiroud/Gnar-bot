Claw or spear, your end's the same.
Mmm, the taste of coward.
We'll prey on the civilized.
I'll show these house cats real claws.
The untamed know no fear.
I will guide you.

On the prowl.
You call this civilized?
You cannot cage me, summoner.
Instinct guides my steps.
Here mousy, mousy, mousy...
Did I mention it's mating season?

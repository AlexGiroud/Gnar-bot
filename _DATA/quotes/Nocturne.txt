Embrace the darkness.
Cut them from this world!
Suffer eternally!
Their twilight approaches.
The light is fading.
Drip drop, the sound of blood.
Help is not coming...
I sense fear.
Do I scare you, summoner?
Are you getting tired yet?
This place disgusts me.
People are flames to be blotted out.
Afraid of the dark?
Cross over.
Swim in terror!
Are you my nightmare, or am I yours?
Bring me more flesh bags to slice up!
Weather forecast for tonight: dark, with a chance of pain!
All alone...
Darkness...
Darkness...
Fate cannot be averted.
So it must be.
No further meddling
Despair in our presence!
Their impudence ends.
No recourse for survival.
They are right to fear.
Deprive them of life.
They pose unacceptable risk.
Their existence is a mistake.
Long have we waited.
The end of days draws near.
Fulfill destiny.
A blight takes this land.
What was, is, and will forever be.
A trail manifests.
We transcend time.
The first are we. The last are we.
We are one.
We see all. We know all. We are... stuck!
We have learned of spin to win. None can stop... it was a trick!
Scanning... failure is your destiny.
Beings of this plane are no threat.
Oblivion.
Pierce the veil.
We disengage.
We shall restore.
To the point of origin.

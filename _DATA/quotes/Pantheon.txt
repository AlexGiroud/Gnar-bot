They are privileged to die at my feet!
Their fate is sealed.
They will not enjoy this.
They disgrace the art of war.
With pleasure.
Consider it done.
Without pause.
With pride.
Let us press on.
Immediately.
Do not provoke me.
My spear is restless.
Honor compels me!
Onward!
They will know war.
I know my path.
Getting kicked into a well is the least of your worries!
My profession?! You know, now that I think of it, I've always wanted to be a baker.
Yes, a baker.

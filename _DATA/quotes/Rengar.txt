Tonight we hunt!
Walk the killer's path.
I seek only the strongest.
Catch their trail.
Comfort breeds weakness.
A true hunter never rests.
The scent of prey.
Monsters can be made to fear.
Strike when ready.
There is the hunter and the hunted.
Whose head shall I take?
A fitting prize.
Nothing will escape.
Carve off a souvenir.
Another piece for my collection.
Their heads will adorn my wall.
Lesser creature.
Let's see what they're made of.
All these trophies... I'm gonna need a bigger den!
So much bloodshed... This is my kind of place!
You have a warrior's heart. I think I'll take it.
You've earned a good death. I've earned the kill.
Spoils of the hunt.
Never return empty-handed.
A token of my conquests.
I'm just getting started.
A fine collection.
More prey, more prizes.
Leave only a trail of bodies.
What a glorious hunt.
Come on!
Let's fight!
Not so fast!
Slow down!
Don't trip.
Easy prey.
Listen.
Focus.
I see you, wretched creature!
I've found you, beast!

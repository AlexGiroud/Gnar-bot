Trust nothing but your strength.
Winter is coming
They will feed my boar.
Die with weapon in hand.
Prove your worth.
Trample them!
I was born for conquest.
Stand and fight!
I won't be denied!
I was forged by winter.
Show them our teeth.
Run them down!
Bristle, attack!
Leave no survivors.
Seize what's ours.
You own what you take.
Fight or make room for those who will.
Deeds, not words.
We fight while cowards talk.
No spoils for the meek.
Living in fear is not living at all.
I will not tolerate weakness.
I will not hide behind another shield.
Bristle seems hungry today...
We bow to no one!
The cold does not forgive.
There is no strength in servitude.
I will rule the Freljord.
Pain is nothing.
Ride onward!
Flee like the cowards you are!
Don't worry, Bristle, I'll leave you the scraps.
Those who oppose me get gored.
Easy, Bristle. The archer's mine.
Which will snap more easily? The bow, or you?
Ice Witch, prepare to be shattered!
Who wants a treat? Bristle wants a treat? Not until we've trampled our foes to dust!
Can you smell coward, Bristle? Get 'em!
Stampede!
Charge!
Die!
There's no use running!
A gift from the Freljord!
We settle this, here, and now!
I rule the Freljord!
For my ancestors!
Trample them.
Bristle, attack!
Run them down!
Strike at their heart.
Leave no survivors.
This is our fight!
Prove your worth, summoner!
To the bitter end.
We will endure!
Ride onward.
Do not relent.
Victory at any cost.
I belong in battle.
I will rule Freljord.
You'll make excellent boar food.
Those who oppose me get gored!
Hey, get up! How many times have I told you: 'No sleeping during battle!'
Hey, wake up! No dinner for you, tonight.
Stampede!
Trample!

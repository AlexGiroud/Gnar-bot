They are nothing before me.
Suffer my fury.
The might of Demacia will prevail.
The rage.
They see their end.
They are nothing before me.
By the blood of my father, I will end them.
I go.
The dragon nears.
On wings of fury.
The enemies of Demacia will fall.
Without remorse.
The quiet before battle.
I smell fear.
They should run now.
They have faced nothing like me.
Come get a glimpse into the belly of the beast!
What do you get when a dragon sneezes? (Chuckles) Out of the way.
Fragile creatures.
I will dance in their ashes.
Feel my talons.
Fear me.
Behold my true form.
Tremble before the power of a dragon.
Power flows through me.
I am unleashed.
Think you're a dragon slayer? Come here and try.

Let me guide you.
By the power of the stars.
They will know serenity.
Be at peace.
Violence cannot go unanswered.
They will go no further.
What must be done.
Such hatred in their hearts.
This is my path.
For peace of mind.
Gracefully.
Where am I needed?
I heed their call.
Every step; a new journey.
To heal and protect.
Never waste a breath.
The whole world in balance.
I lend my aid.
No, I'm not happy to see you. Yes, that is a horn growing out of my head.
Yes, that was a banana. *giggles* No one expects the banana.
Do you always fight so poorly?
I will not save you.
Stars hear me!
Live!
For life!
Have hope!

The early bird guts the worm.
A calculated risk.
My bird is hungry.
Impeccable decision.
They dare oppose Noxus?
My pleasure.
Dispatch these worms.
A Noxian does not dawdle.
My destination is absolute.
I'll give the orders.
Victory awaits.
I'm five steps ahead of you.
If you insist.
My thoughts exactly.
How obvious.
Efficient strategy.
Another opponent, another disappointment.
I bet you taste like chicken.
If we approach strategically from the flank... oh, who am I kidding? Let's just morph and eat them.
You're seriously asking a giant demon bird... for a joke?
Seriously, again? Just drop it!
Think logically for one seco- CAW CAW CAWCAWCAW!!

Know the loom. Be the stone.
The sun rises... I must go!
A bird's trust is not in the branch.
I'm going ahead.
Every tapestry begins with a single stitch.
The ground here conceals a mighty power.
The stone here is amazing!
The wounds of this land run deep.
Looks like you're stuck between me and a hard place.
Our paths have woven together for a reason.
Sometimes, learning hurts.
Oh, good, just what I need.
I've given up too much to let you stop me.
Mastery is a journey. Here's your first lesson.
Okay, great, that is actually what I wanted to have happen. For once.
My father always said I was a shepherd's nightmare.
It will take more than you to break me.
Every lesson is a gift.
Control, control, control...
Maybe I'm your</b> lesson.
Experience is the best teacher.
My gift, my responsibility.
How's this</b> for throwing stones?
I'm still here.
One stone at a time.
I meant to do that - mostly.
Even rocks can be unpredictable.
A rock in my hand is worth two in your face!
Beware falling rocks!
How did I do that?
That looks like it hurt!
Either way, I'm going to learn something from this.
Looks like you've got a thing or two to learn yourself.
Alright, I've got this.
Leave no stone unturned.
Like threading a needle.
Every rock tells a story. This one might be painful.
So anyway... bam!
I'll deal with it.
Don't mess with a stoneweaver.
I'm... kind of amazing.
That was pretty much... amazing.
I am the rock!
I am the stone beneath your feet.
Courage is stronger than stone.
The best defense is a strong foundation.
You pulled the wrong thread.
Stand back.
You underestimate me.
Not all who wander are lost.
I'm the rock the river cannot wash away!
Oh, good, just what I need.
Great, now</b> who am I going to learn from?
Five birds, one stone.
That... was... amazing! Let us see if I can do it again!
Some walls were meant to come down.
Wow... you're tall.
As before, we will stand against you.
Your fire is nothing compared to the desert heat.
I looked for your kind at the ends of the earth.
Yours is a tangled web.
My weave is made of sturdier stuff.
A sparrow flies against the wind.
What magnificent stone.
A stone here is so beautiful.
A great Weaver says every lesson is a gift.
The earth hides many secrets.
Hard work polishes the roughest stones.
The desert's beauty lies beneath the sand.
I must finish my task.
Keep your eyes on the horizon and your feet on the ground.
My journey is not yet at an end.
A tribe without tradition is a flock without a shepherd.
It is up to all of us to see beauty in the bare stone.
Distance means so little when family means so much.
The earth calls, and I must answer.
To conquer our fears, we must move forward.
So long as the desert blooms, there is hope.
Every pebble holds infinite potential.
What an interesting pattern.
True learning is just a stone's throw away.
Oh, look, a rock... and another... and another!
I know all of this will lead me home someday.
Every stone weaves a different story.
This world is a tapestry of our own making.
No use staying in one place.
The earth here... such colours.
Nothing ventured, nothing learned.
I keep moving, but my feet are on solid ground.
If I stumble, I have the earth to catch me.
The world is my loom, and every stone my thread.
This world is frayed, and in need of mending.
Every pebble holds infinite potential.
I think I've learned what I need to here.
I must push myself harder next time.
The warmth of the desert calls me home.
No choice is written in stone.
There's no place like home.
Feels good to be back.
Time to roll up my sleeves.
Just when I start to appreciate the view, it is time to move on.
Maybe I'm here to teach you something.
You're never too old to learn something new.
Go ahead, push me. We'll both find out what I'm made of.
You're not a problem, you're a learning opportunity.
I'm not afraid of you.
You are out of your depth.
You're no artist, just a hired gun!
Beauty is no excuse for so much suffering.
Master Yasuo, remember me?
I knew we'd meet again.
I've learned much since we last met.
Let me show you what I've learned.
The promises of Noxus are nothing but lies.
I will take no part in your war machine.
You are nothing but plunderers and poachers.
We will not trade the yoke of one empire for another.
The earth will rip itself apart before it falls to Noxus.
Noxus promised learning, but delivered only bloodshed.
The sands have revealed your true form.
You have poisoned your own heart.
This is how the desert repays thieves.
Noxians... why did it have to be Noxians?
Scavengers!
You are not wanted here.
We are stronger than you think.
Leave our world!
You are the scourge upon our world.
Are Icathia's secrets truly the key?
Tell us what we need to stand against those creatures.
You have betrayed our people to chaos.
The stone of Shurima will stand against those creatures.
You will stalk the sands no more.
You breed chaos like a rabid ralsiji!
Your pattern weaves nothing but chaos.
Want to examine some stone up close?
How's that for dirt in your eye?
Sounds like somebody needs a nap.
Playtime is going to get a little rocky.
Even the smallest stone can shake the heavens.
Remember there is stone beneath your sand.
We have prospered without you.
Your servants will resist.
There is no empire without the people.
Close to the ground, the sparrow flies faster than the falcon.
Shurima will live on without you.
Better to build on stone than sand.
You forget your people.
Shouldn't you be home polishing your Sun Disc?
Did the earth move for you too? Did I just say that out loud?
Don't be silly. Scarecrows don't talk.
Don't worry. I don't stay in one place for long.
Life and death are two ends of the same thread.
Our future is not yet off the loom.
Worry is a heavier burden than stone.
Do not give up before the journey is finished.
Even the most barren desert blooms in time.
You sure you're alright?
You sure you're okay?
Your resurrection has twisted your mind.
Stone sealed your tomb once. It will again.
I will mend what you have sundered.
This time, rock beats paper!
He may be your blood, but we are your people.
You have a choice, Sivir.
Do not turn your back on what is right.
I feel your tribe sleeping below the earth.
Is it hard to be the protector of so many?
I know the power that lies beneath.
Ooh, you're pretty. Guys can be pretty, right?
It is the shepherd's duty to drive the wolf away.
You are nothing but a sheep in wolf's clothes.
Yours is the ill wind that begat his wrath.
Problems should be broken up into little pieces.
Take this!
Tag, you're it!
If at first you don't succeed, throw another rock!
I told you to stand back!
You've strayed too far!
Up you go!
Burst!
Erupt!
Rise!
Maybe you should go over there!
Away with you!
It's never good to run from your problems.
Watch your step.
Mind your footing.
You're standing on shaky ground.
Tread lightly.
Never dismiss what's beneath your feet.
Better to build from the ground up.
Time to divide the flock.
Let's shake things up.
Time to go with the flow.
This... is... amazing!
How amazing is this?
You can run from a landslide, I prefer to ride it!
Here I come!
You have to try that.
That may have gotten away from me.
Totally. Epic.
Did you see that?
Oh, great, I needed this.
Glad they had this in stock.
Ooh, I need one of those.
Better safe than sorry.
Never hurts to be prepared.
Glad I could pick this up.
This should work.
Learning is always faster with the right tools.
Every girl needs a good pair of boots.
These boots were made for weaving.
Clear vision brings hope.
This should make the pattern easier to follow.
Time to see the pattern in the weave.
A rock in the bush is worth five in the hand.
Ooh, belts!
Diamonds really are a girl's best friend.
This currency carries weight beyond the sands.
My father carried one of these.
A vision most welcome in the sands.
A relic of the old ways.
Stick them with the pointy end.
I fear no apparitions.
Let's see what I can pull out of this hat.
Some hats speak louder than words.
Huh, towers are stone too. Interesting.
One more reason to keep moving.
The great Weaver protects me.
Time for a sigh of relief.
Time to apply what I've learned.
I haven't seen this stone before.
Time to carry a bigger stick.
Time to go big or go home.
Time to throw the book at them too.
Time to fight magic with more magic.
Rocks should really come with an instruction manual.
A little chaos should shake things up.
That sand reminds me of home.
Choices. Those are my only true possessions.
The midday toil is the most difficult.
Evening is upon us. Let us finish this.
Almost better than goat's milk.
Refreshing.
Tastes like sunshine.
Clear vision is best when there are many paths.
Action without vision is a nightmare.
Vision guides the thread.
Big dreams require a lot of vision.
Girls with dreams become women with vision.
You cannot be what you cannot envision.
Shared vision unite the tribe.
Time to make vision a reality.
Know what makes snowballs more fun? Rocks!
Let me break the ice for you!
Yes! I mean - cool. Totally cool.
The greatest danger lies beneath the ice.
Ice betrays the sure-footed.
Cold does not forgive.
For the Freljord.
The glaciers see you tremble.
Ice and stones will break your bones.
How about a snowball fight?
Even mountains can crumble.
Even the smallest stone can start an avalanche.
Brace yourself - I hear winter is coming.
The mountains breathe beneath the snow.
I traded dunes of sand for drifts of snow.
I guess ice it is.
Best way to stay warm is the keep moving.
The ice is beautiful.
The snow sparkles like desert stars.
Nothing beats walking on fresh snow.
The snow falling is a thing of wonder.
The sight of glaciers takes my breath away.
The Freljord isn't barren, but waits to be revealed.
I long for the warmth of the desert.
Queen, do not forget your people.
The tribes of the Freljord must unite.
My father was a shepherd too!
You love goat's milk? I love goat's milk!
The ice rebels against your corruption!
The glaciers will resist the darkness!

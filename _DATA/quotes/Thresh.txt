What delightful agony we shall inflict.
Writhe, like a worm on a hook.
Nobody escapes.
Death? No... nothing that simple.
Come out and play.
It's over when I say.
Lock 'em up.
Wretched mongrels get the leash.
Any last words?
Oh, yes! It's about to get much worse.
No one can save them.
Ah, the sweet tones of misery.
Relax, just... let go.
Me, mad? Haha... quite likely.
Hmm, whose mind shall we snap?
Poor lost souls.
Oh, the eternity we shall spend together.
Flesh is a prison.
What is the worth of a soul?
I am the thing under the bed.
Torment comes in so many flavors.
Screaming won't do you any good, but it's music to my ears.
There is life. There is death. And then there is me.
Ever seen your soul? Would you like to?
You're falling apart. What to do with the pieces?
Round we go!
This way!
I own you.
My house, my rules.
Closing in...
Nowhere to hide.
Going somewhere?</i>
Come back!
Hook, line and sinker!
Stars culled of life, silent in the darkness.
No weapon in any reality can harm us.
I will guide them beyond the brink of infinity.
Do not fear the end. Embrace it.
We are shadows cast by darkness.
Stillness for all eternity.
Eternity beckons.
Another soul to feed the endless hunger.
Submit to infinity.
They struggle. How meaningless.
Enter the horizon.
We are the death of hope.
The meaning of life is that it stops.
Their suffering makes us stronger.
The galaxy will suffocate in darkness.
Come. Bear witness.
I am the herald of reality's end.
I will carve my way across the stars.
Gaze into the eye of annihilation.
We will all collapse into one.
Snuff them out.
We hunger.
A dark star rises.
Brave souls, destroyed and consumed.
Soul or no, I will feed it to the nothingness.
I've destroyed realities. What threat is this beast?
A baron, eh? Baron of a dead world.
We've destroyed our fair share of dragons.
Those wings offer no escape.
Just another stupid beast.
Let's see how dark it can really get.
Infinity, rapture, I am their harbinger.
We will consume this world.
Cosmic extinction - how lovely.
The stars are no longer infinite.
We sup upon the living galaxies themselves.
Great works, broken and destroyed.
The cry of a dying star - nothing's sweeter.
Oh, how I long for the final kiss of annihilation.
A star can scream. Isn't that strange?
I envy those who journey into the nothingness.
All things are eventually extinguished.
Ours is a kingdom of darkness.
Not even gods dare look within.
I will chain the very heavens and drag them down.
Even the universe will grind to a halt.
A sinister star indeed.
We shall suck the marrow from their stars.
Look at you. I think I'll keep you. Or not.
Oh, I've always wanted one of these... oh man.
Beyond the stars... hide horrors far greater than any can imagine.
Nothing escapes the pull of eternity.
Do not prolong the inevitable.
Enough death and darkness... even for you.
You are not prepared for this journey.
Have you ever seen a thousand stars alight in a shared dawn? We have - just before we snuffed them out.
Not even a star can escape our grip.
Join your precious stars in oblivion.
Just try to take it, sackman!
Come to me, my herald.
Serve well, and you shall die well.
Go forth and destroy.
Together, we shall watch the last star die.
What better revenge... than complete annihilation?
Your betrayal will not save them.
Your betrayal will not save them.
Suns, moons? We have devoured both.
Time is but a cog in a dying machine.
Suns, moons? We have devoured both.
What is one life among billions?
Join her in oblivion.
Ah, the light of Demacia. So sweet.
We will show you true darkness.
How will you protect an entire world when you cannot even save yourself?
Pretenders to the throne of annihilation.
We have looked into the Void, and consumed it.
Time is but a cog in a dying machine.
How do you intend to stop entropy incarnate?
The nothingness accepts all.
Oh, what a wonderful world.
A trillion souls to go.
A fine start.
Nothing escapes our hunger.
Join us in death.
Nowhere left to run.
My pull is inexorable.
Space is no impediment.
Distance is an illusion.
Your efforts are meaningless.
We shall hunt you to the ends of creation.
Embrace entropy.
Take a trip to the end of the world.
Feel my power.
Of your own accord.
Join me.
Become part of something greater - nothingness.
Death is but a dream.
The downward spiral.
You are now in my orbit.
We are inescapable.
The stars die as we approach.
Infinity is confined.
There is nowhere to run. We've destroyed it all.
Their screams sing me to my eternal sleep.
Dreadful symmetry.
Welcome to the event horizon.
How charming.
Fine craftsmanship - for a dead people.
Oh, such destruction to come!
Not nearly big enough.
Mortal trappings.
My other belt is made of dead stars.
Even the least of them may yet serve us in death.
Speed their deaths.
Eye for an eye.
Ah, if it could only kindle hope. Haha!
Useful.
A bauble.
Targon should brace itself.
I'll take it.
They won't be needing this.
No legion can stand before us.
What's an aegis anyway?
Use their defenses against them.
Not quite my style - but it will have to do.
Hm, they worship suns. Too bad.
We'll make relics of them all.
A means to the end.
Wait 'til they get a load of us.
Annihilation awaits.
If the universe cared, it would stop us.
I am the vanishing point on all horizons.
They all seem to die with a whimper.
They feed the very engine of their destruction.
Not even light can escape us.
None living shall escape my sight.
Just because you are beneath my notice doesn't mean I can't see you.
Hiding will not save you.
Leave nothing to chance.
One day, this hunger will be sated.
Watch the stars blink out, one by one.
Much more work to do.
The embrace of nothingness...
Oh, thank you...
Finally...
Only a few more stars, a few more galaxies...
Time, space, reality - we shall consume all.
Beware - I live.
Death is no escape.
Become one in death.
Yes...

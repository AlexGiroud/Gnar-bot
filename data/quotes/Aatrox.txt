This battle will be my masterpiece.
Cut the courage from them.
Every kill brings victory closer.
There will be no retreat.
Fight or be forgotten.
Honor will not save them.
Break and fall.
Teach them to fear us.
Now we turn the tide!
Sow the seeds of strife.
Rage against the dying of the light.
Violence is elegance.
Pain is temporary, victory is forever!
Peace is the greatest lie of all.
War reveals what is within us.
Surpass the frailty of your form.
They will greet you as heroes.
True warriors are born in blood!
I am as timeless as war.
Let fear become fury!
I know what lurks in the hearts of men.
Hesitation is death.
Nobody understands me! They called my work a hack job.
This is no mere massacre; this is my masterwork!
Fight and be remembered as a hero, or die and be remembered as a coward.
Fight as a hero, or die as a coward.
Fight and be remembered, or die and be forgotten.
Die with fear in your heart, or win with blood on your hands.
Even those who have nothing can give their lives.
Witness truth!
Behold!
Tryndamere, my greatest creation.
This one's rage will shape the world.

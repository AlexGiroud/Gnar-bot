Don't you trust me?
Play time's over.
They're mine now.
It's too late for mercy.
Let's have some real fun.
No one will stand in my way.
They've exhausted their use.
Shall we?
Indulge me.
How tempting.
Don't hold back.
Tell me a secret.
Don't you trust me?
I know what they desire.
Should I make your pulse rise? Or... STOP!</i> (giggles)
If you'd like to play with me, you'd better be sure you know the game.
Come try your luck, if you think you're in my league.</i> (giggles)

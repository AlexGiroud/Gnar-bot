As balance dictates.
Without question.
Whatever's necessary.
Mark acquired.
Another unworthy opponent.
A necessary sacrifice.
Honor is the blade's edge.
Deftly I travel.
Understood.
Through twilight's veil.
Tread lightly.
Agreed.
Remain focused.
Hesitation is the seed of defeat.
Symmetry in all things.
We travel the same path.
I suggest you run... I want to savor this.
So many noobs... will matchmaking ever find true balance?

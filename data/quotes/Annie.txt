You wanna play too? It'll be fun!
Take that!
Don't make me hurt you!
Eeny, meeny, miny, burn!
Let's count to five!
I want a turn!
Play time!
Can they do this?
This is fun!
Ashes, ashes, they all fall down.
Have you seen my bear Tibbers?
This way!
Try to keep up!
Are we there yet?
I never play with matches.
Don't be a scaredy cat!
Hop, skip, jump!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
You smell like burning!
What's your favorite animal? A bear?
Beaten by a little girl... ha!
You can't come to Tibbers' tea party! Bleh!
I'm rubber and you're... on fire!
Get 'em, Tibbers!
Bear hug!
Tibbers!
Yay, Tibbers!
Found him!
Uh... *cough* Tibbers.

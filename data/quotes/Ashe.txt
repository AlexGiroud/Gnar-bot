All the world on one arrow.
Right between the eyes!
My aim is steady.
Avarosa guide me.
My arrows fly true.
I won't miss!
Lead the target.
Make it count.
I only need one shot!
Let's see how close they can get.
No one escapes my aim.
Strike quickly!
For the Freljord!
Let fly!
Swiftly now!
We must press on!
Do not confuse mercy for weakness.
Peace requires a steady hand.
Never lose focus.
Stand together!
Faster than my arrow? I think not.
I won't lead us astray.
United, we are stronger!
We are one people.
I will unite the Freljord.
I do my best work from afar.
We're on the right path.
I always take the high ground.
How do you like the curves? I was talking about the bow.
Take a good look; it's the last you'll get.
Keep staring... just don't look behind you.
Misguided warmonger!
Foolish Sejuani.
So, which one is the pig?
To pierce your black heart!
Your twisted ways must be stopped!
I will end your corruption!
No, really, put that apple on your head... ugh! Ah... ohh... hmm... 
I don't have to see you to shoot you... ow! Ugh... ooh, really?
Ha hah! Check this out... ow! Ugh, who makes a bow out of ice?!
Reveal what is hidden.
Lead the way.
Show me a path!
Form up on me. Attack pattern Epsilon.
Let's move out, team.
You have your objectives.
Be careful out there.
Stay frosty.
In my sights.
Breathe... and release.
Wait for the shot.
No surrender!
Neutralizing interference.
Target acquired.
For humanity!
Open fire!
Right between the optics.
Target lock.
Permission to engage.
Laser cooling is go.
Taking the shot.
I've got your heat death.

Make it count.
In my sights.
In the crosshairs.

Sure shot.
Engaging hostiles.
Make every shot count!
I won't miss!
Shots fired!
I've got a bead!
Pin them down!
Rapid fire!
Five rounds rapid!
Full auto!
Memories are more than ones and zeroes.
We aren't weapons, we're human beings.
Five by five.
Stand beside me.
Erasing our memories only ensures we repeat our mistakes.
Today only matters if we can remember it tomorrow.
We will end their tyranny.
All I need to achieve the impossible is the right team.
The role between woman and weapon blurs.
The source code lies.
They cannot take our pasts from us.
Will always trumps programming.
My humanity cannot be overwritten.
So long as you refuse to obey, you are human.
Freedom is ours.
Our will is stronger than their steel.
This oppression will not last.
Memories are what make us human.
The true mission is to oneself.
Humanity isn't a defect.
Salvation, bit by bit.
Each reboot, a fresh guiltless mind.
Fresh scars remind me - I'm still human.
Join the resistance.
Information will set them free.
I will reveal the truth.
Bring it all crashing down.
They promised us infinite possibility. They lied.
Our struggle continues.
My dream is freedom for us all.
Operating at full potential.
We will free the others.
Resistance is not futile - it's human.
Never trade freedom for security.
Entering enemy territory.
Recon mode initiated.
Hit them hard.
Armour up.
Let's do this.
I don't recall us being friends.
Stand down or be put down.
You don't want to get on my bad side.
The fact that you're following orders doesn't make you any less responsible.
If you stand in my way, you won't be standing long.
Ugh, did I ever dress like that?
You're part of the problem.
You represent everything I despise.
Who would willingly do that to himself?
I thought you'd be taller.
What are you?
You must be Bad Ashe.
Good? Bad? I'm the one with the bow.
May the best me win.
Scatter shot!
Multiple targets engaged!
Keep their heads down!
Suppressing fire!
Bound to connect!
Drone deployed.
Scouting ahead.
Let's have a look.
Rendering flight path.
Tracking enemy movements.
Identify targets.
Aerial recon is go.
Overcharging!
Fly!
Boom.
Engage!
Gearing up.
This will do nicely.
External upgrades are the way to go.
While I'm here... 
Rate of fire increased.
Strike fast, strike hard.
Maximum efficiency.
Double time.
Mobility is the key to victory.
Get in, get out.
This upgrade is mission critical.
Exploit any flaws in their armour.
The odds of victory just increased exponentially.
It is a giant we seek to fell.
Evening the odds.
The bigger they are... 
Been saving up for this.
Compliments of a... concerned citizen.
Stopping power and</b> armour penetration.
For this dance, I'll lead.
I'm untouchable.
Ghost in the machine.
Bloodthirst's one emotion I could actually do without.
Hemophagic upgrade installed.
Bleeding edge tech.
Burst fire, eh?
Controlled bursts are key.
Triple tap - better safe than sorry.
Amping up my arsenal.
Should overcome standard EMP shielding.
Power surge could force a reboot.
Seems easy enough to retrofit.
Point blank just got a lot longer.
Rapid Firecannon - when you've absolutely, positively got to kill every cyborg supersoldier in the room, accept no substitutes.
Forcefield projector, eh? Handy.
This thing can really take a hit.
Keeps threats at arm's length.
I'm no-one's puppet.
Close calls are what I do.
You may catch me, but you can't hold me.
I won't be stopped.
A memetic polyalloy - nice.
She who fights and runs away... 
Counter-kinetic ablative shielding.
Neural freezing technology.
Like they're moving in slow motion.
Faster reloads.
Worth every credit.
Stretching out my power reserves.
What a waste.
Poor bastard.
You chose the wrong side.
You left me no choice.
Your fight is over.
Seize the advantage!
We've got them right where we want them!
That escalated quickly.
You might want to rethink your strategy.
I can do this all day.
Target neutralized.
Defenses down.
Push them back!
Enemy fortification destroyed.
Objective achieved.
One and done nanite treatment.
Ah, that's better.
This will get me back in the fight.

Keep your head on a swivel.
Downloading intel.
Querying location.
Check your corners.
Remote sensor activated.
Covering our escape routes.
I've got eyes everywhere.

When they come, we'll be ready.
Be back, ASAP.
Heading back to base.
Hold the line while I'm gone.
Resupplying.
Recon complete.
Keep fighting... 
Medic... 
The fate of our people hangs in the balance.
The Freljord unites!

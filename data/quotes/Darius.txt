They will regret opposing me.
They will regret opposing me.
Death by my hand.
With overwhelming force.
Exploit every weakness.
Witness true strength.
Unmatched power!
Scurry, weakling.
I will not rest.
Strength above all.
Noxus will rise.
I do not tolerate cowardice.
Make no mistakes.
Carve a path.
Never retreat!
Stay alert.
My destination is clear.
I have my orders.
Don't turn your back, or expose your neck.
Defy Noxus and taste your own blood.
Autographs after the game.
I don't need a buzzer to tell me when to start dominating.
The dunk prophecies are true. Darius has arrived.
You even trying?
You know who I am.
I burn the playbook.
You all play. I win!
I'm here to dunk.
You the mascot?
Talent wins games. Period.
I make it happen.
Hey, it's a physical game.
Win or go home.
It looks easy, but I'm just that good.
It's okay to be afraid... if you're bad.
My stats speak for themselves.
What you didn't see? Quickness.
Eye on the ball - or your face.
Don't hate the player - hate yourself.
The key to victory is giving me the ball.
I'm the full package. Playmaker, spine breaker.
Whose court is this? Damn right it's mine!
Dunk is the gift I give to you.
Like my kicks? Take a closer look!
You want a piece of the D-man?
Every lane is my lane.
Darius knows dunk.
Dunkin' ain't easy.
I execute - on goals.
What's 'passing'?
It's all muscle memory.
Always dunk for the throat.
I don't give 100%, I take it.
What the ref doesn't see is legal.
It's game time.
I don't practice.
Don't break rules, dunk them.
Whose house? My house.
Any game I play is a home game.
When you're finished training, train more.
I don't play the game, I am the game.
I don't see a team, I see coattail passengers.
There's no I in team, but there is one in Darius.
Somebody had to be me, might as well be me.
Better call traveling because I'm going places.
Is this seriously what I'm up against?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise this was a charity game.
Amateur hour.
You might wanna go get a day job.
Be straight with me - who let you in here?
Here's a good candidate for the Hall of Shame.
Why'd you show up without my towel?
This is the dunk train, running you down.
Was your plan: all pain, no gain?
No-one wants to play with you, Amumu.
Hey, mummy! I'll give you something to cry about!
Oh look, Amumu. Your coach run out of last picks?
Dat fail.
Judging by your face, Brand, I'd say we've met before.
What do cops and donuts have in common? I dunk them!
Diana. Pale, white and cratered.
Hey, Draven! Momma said you were adopted!
You'll go where I tell you, Mundo.
Hey, Mundo! I hope you please to go to the fountain.
Nice glove, Ezreal, maybe you can use it to pick yourself up after the game.
Fiddlesticks. Spooky.
Arrrr... you suck.
Nice spin, Garen, that'll help while I run circles around you.
What's your secret ingredient, Gragas? Failure?
Bring an umbrella, it's raining dunks!
Hey, Lee Sin! Feast your eyes on--- oh, my bad.
Oh no, it's Leona. I'm gonna get a tan.
Uh oh, here comes Lulu and the butterfly.
Sorry, Malphite, I've got the rock now!
Hey, Maokai, I know a court you might've been related to!
Maokai, you'd be better as the bench.
What is it you mastered, Yi? Sucking?
Nocturne. Spooky.
I don't get nightmares, Nocturne, but you are</b> putting me to sleep.
Thanks, Orianna, you brought a ball for me to dunk on you with!
Ball up again, Rammus. Makes it easier to dunk you.
Look alive, Sion! Oh, right.
Hi, Sona! That was the sound of you failing!
Sona, I hear you can't talk. I know you can't play.
You called for a star, Soraka?
You look as good as you play, Trundle.
Udyr - four stances, no style.
Those are some pretty big hands to drop the ball with, Vi.
The only blood on the court will be yours, Vlad.
Rewind that, Zilean, I wanna see it again.
Go home, shrub.
Got my PhD in Dunk... and class is in session.
I'm in the business of dunking, and business is good.
From the fountain, off your face, nothing but dunk.
Back off!
Watch it!
Get fouled!
Street rules!
Want some?
Bring it!
Come here!
Take notes!
Dunkmate!
My house!
Get dunked!
Too easy!
Sit down!
Boom!
Da dunk!
There it is!
See ya!
Yeah!
Rookie!
Dropped!
Knock knock!
Eat it!
Faced!
All day!
Thanks for playing!
Shoes are worth more after I wear them.
They should pay me to wear these.
Noxus Air - the only brand I wear.
It isn't the shoes, it's me.
If you like my shoes, you can always find them stomping all over the competition!
It's not gear until someone bleeds on it.
You gotta' want it, you gotta' bleed for it.
I'm gonna rename this - Dunkthirster!
Let me teach you about persistence.
Stay on the man.
Reliable tools are the only way Darius gets the job done. Frozen Mallet - put your problems on ice!
Infinity Dunk on the way.
For a dunk legend like me, only Infinity Edge will do. Infinity Edge - the closest shave.
Put your Mortius where your mouth is!
Let 'em think you're done, then put it down!
I'm the only magic allowed on the court.
Knowing you're up against Darius is all the omen you need.
Everyone around me is moving in slow motion.
You can try to foul me. Really - try</b>.
When I'm hungry, I turn to Ravenous Hydra. Pure energy - no carbs.
Triple team me! Save me some time!
You can all share... in the dunkstruction!
Yeah! Come guard me now!
That's right, I'm on what?
Put more people on me. I like it.
You think I was hot before?
The Trinity is where dunk meets dunk... meets... dunk.
Three reasons I'm the best - D, U, and Unk.
Three way dunk? I got this.
You gotta see the whole court.
Keep your head on a swivel.
There. Don't say I'm not a team player.
Quick substitution.
The game will resume when I return.
I'll be back, delay the game.
Stay hydrated.
Put me back in.
So this is what the bench looks like.

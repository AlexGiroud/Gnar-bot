The night is my veil... 
With pleasure.
Your pain is my pleasure.
All too easy.
I can smell their fear.
Time to feed.
Misery loves company.
I've got the touch.
This way.
If I must.
Shadows beckon.
From the darkness.
Into the night!
The night is my veil.
It takes a lot of effort to move like this in heels.
Mmm, I like it when they scream.
I may be bad, but I feel good...

I long for a worthy opponent.
Insolent peasants!
Run them through!
Prepare to die.
They dare not strike back.
To the death.
I never hold back.
Strike quickly, strike deftly.
Precision and grace.
I have no equal.
Do not hesitate.
Sharp blade, sharp mind.
Others try. I succeed.
At once.
In the blink of an eye.
Is this supposed to be a challenge?
Such unrefined style.
Talent, honor, discipline, and pretty pictures!
I am an artist with a sword, in more ways than one.
Submit! You have already lost.
I like you. I hate to kill you.
En garde!
Try me!
Your move.
Stand ready.
One step ahead!
Poor form!
Too slow!
Try again.

I never hold back.
Strike quickly, strike deftly.
Let them eat swords.
Precision and grace.
I have no equal.
Do not hesitate.
Sharp blade, sharp mind.

Let me at 'em!
The tide turns.
The mighty shark stalks his prey.
Now we strike.
To the briny deep.
I'll show them a watery grave.
I'm ready.
Swimmingly.
C'mon, let's go!
Wanna see a trick?
No fear!
One jump ahead of you.
They won't catch me.
In a splash.
Land, ho!
You're boring.
Not interested.
Hmm, something's fishy.
Fish, fish fish!
Shark!
Lunch time!
Feeding time!

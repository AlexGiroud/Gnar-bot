Neither the flames nor the depths could claim me.
With sword and shot I'll take my island back.
They took my ship - I'll take their lives.
My flesh will never burn.
Bilgewater - home bitter stinkin' home.
Bilgewater - your king has returned.
Hack their kidneys out.
They have no concept of misery.
One slash, ear to ear.
Crying won't do any good.
Pistols or blades, don't matter to me.
Paint the docks in their blood.
Dead men tell my</b> tale.
Feed 'em their fingers.
Their tears will salt the ocean.
I'll take my time with 'em.
I see corpses waiting to drop.
Blade to bone, that's the way.
I will carve my name in their skulls.
This is</b> mercy in Bilgewater!
Toss 'em to the sharks.
Bones'll splinter.
You haven't seen blood yet.
Their bodies will choke the abyss.
My heart is iron.
I'll burn it all down if I can't have it.
I'll take back what's mine!
I found my hate in the fire.
I rarely forget, and never forgive.
A turned back deserves a knife.
Hang 'em from the slaughterdocks.
Never trust a bilgerat!
I lost my ship, but not my soul.
Do I look like a patient man?
I am reborn of salt and brine.
The sea has no memory - but I do.
Betrayal stings like salt on a wound.
Hate is a child's word.
My vengeance will be bloody.
Tides of dead will herald my return!
The seas and men betray.
Words mean nothing. Flesh carries weight.
A slit throat is too painless.
I'll hack my way back to Bilgewater.
Mercy sank with my ship.
A reckoning approaches.
A slow death will be their reward.
Death spit me out.
Cruelty for all.
Yar ha har argh -&#160;! (coughs) Had something in my throat.
They're not just oranges - they're blood</b> oranges.
I've got it this time!
I'm back at the helm.
The flames are calling.
The smell of powder sets my blood to boil.
Survive this, and you'll need a lot of rum.
Come, test yourself in the fire!
You will never have a grave, Graves.
You will never have a grave, Graves... see, it's 'cause your name, it's... your name is like a grave, it's - I - never mind.
Can't light cigars in the bottom of the sea.
Will your partner try to avenge you? I hope so.
You talk a lot for a dead man, Graves.
Only thing worse than a traitor is a bad shot.
Can't wear the crown till the king's dead, little girl.
I don't leave anything to fortune any more.
Some bounties aren't worth taking, Fortune.
Sealed your fate when you crossed me, boy.
The seafloor is littered with your ilk, gambler.
Maybe your cards will mourn you.
I don't need a good hand to see your fate.
Everyone pays!
Scum!
Filth!
That's better.
Needed that.
Hits the spot.
Not today!
How they try!
No chance!
Never!
Barrel!
Another!
More powder!
Burn!
Line 'em up!
Three in a row!
Fish in a barrel!
That's a chain!
Combo!
Bathe 'em in iron!
Volley fire!
Cannons!
Broadside!
Main cannon at the ready!
Load up the hull buster!
Heavy artillery for these cowards!
I'll rain fire upon 'em!
All cannons!
I'll hit 'em with everything!
Powder'll get 'em moving!
Charge beneath the barrage!
They'll have reason to run!
Forged in blood and bile.
Nothing cuts dirtier than Bilgewater steel.
A dirty blade for a dirty job.
This blade's got bite!
Sharp enough to etch bone.
This is a flayin' tool.
Always have a shiv at the ready.
Watch 'em twitch.
Sometimes you gotta get your hands bloody.
Blood begets blood.
Killing's the only way to survive.
Got every angle covered.
A captain can't have any blind spots.
An all-purpose artefact.
Keep a weather eye out.
Always watch your back.
Trust nothing to chance.
I'll come back stronger.
Don't get comfortable in my absence.
I'm far from done killing.
They can pay in gold... or blood.
Cannons will sing 'em to sleep.
Cutthroats, criminals and thieves... my kind of people.
The sharks are circling.
The docks may be ugly, but they're home.
Brutality brings loyalty.
Cut 'em from stem to stern.
They're sailing into dark waters.
Grind 'em to chum.
Hoist the colours!
I'll make sails of their skin.
I'm a fair and just man.
March into the ocean's embrace.
Gut 'em like fish.
Strike while the barrel's hot.
Dash 'em against the rocks.
The depths are calling.
I'll grant their death wish.
I'll have their guts for garters.
Heave to!
Face me, swab!
Out with the tide.
To the hilt!
Time for an example.
Here be dragons!
A scared man is a loyal man.
Tongueless men can't talk back.
A blade in the gut solves most problems.
Into the wind!
My ship is my soul.
All I ask is a good ship, and a bad crew.
No-one steals from me.
Sink or swim, lads.
Fight like a man, or die like a dog.
Cowards understand fear. They're smart.
I judge a man by his scars.
The sea may be wicked, but I'm worse.
Cruelty with purpose, boys!
There's only one way in Bilgewater; mine.
I'll carve my name into their bones.
It's sweeter when it's stolen.
Give me a sea dog over a saint any day.
A messy death is your first warning.
Leave 'em with nothing but their fear.
I am as unsinkable as my ship.
They're not just oranges... they're blood</b> oranges!
I have a deficiency... of cares.
Keep your eye on the ball.
A truce? I'll stop shooting when you die!
You'll be dinner for the devilfish.
Which of you cowards wants to cook?!
I'm gonna' hear your innards sizzle!
In good time, the fire'll find ya'!
You talk a lot for a dead man, Graves.
Who let the dog out of his cage?
Graves, two barrels all ya' got?
Prepare to be boarded.
Smiling won't get ya' out of dying, Fortune.
My bounty's on the board, Fortune, and there it stays.
A big gun only hides a small girl.
You're gonna' need a lot more than fortune.
Sailor take warning!
Nautilus, I see you dressed for your destination.
You're gonna' get blood on your dress, Fate.
Feast your eyes on the king, Jack.
You're a losing bet, Fate.
You're just a chip in my game, Fate.
Everyone pays!
Scurvy wretch!
No quarter!
Yo ho!
Refreshing.
Ah.
Hits the spot.
Not today!
Try again!
Free and clear!
Never!
Eat powder!
Barrel!
Have at ya'!
Line 'em up!
Three in a row!
Fish in a barrel!
That's a chain!
Combo!
Bring the rain!
Mortars to the mast!
Cannons!
Broadside!
Ready the main cannon!
Prepare the hull buster!
Bring out the heavy artillery!
More cannons!
All cannons at the ready!
Get ready to hit 'em with all we got!
A little powder gets 'em moving!
Charge beneath the barrage!
This'll give 'em a reason to run!
Forged in blood and bile.
Nothing cuts dirtier than Bilgewater steel.
A dirty blade for a dirty job.
Now this blade's got bite!
Sharp enough to etch bone.
This is a flayin' tool.
Always good to have a shiv at the ready.
I love watching 'em twitch.
Sometimes you gotta' get your hands bloody.
Blood begets blood.
Killing's the best way to survive.
Got every angle covered.
A captain can't have any blind spots.
An all-purpose artefact.
Keep a weather eye out.
Always watch your back.
Trust nothing to chance.
All ashore that's going ashore.
I'll be needing more grog.
Set course for the docks.

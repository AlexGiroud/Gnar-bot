My blade is at your service!
There's no turning back.
Cut them down.
It ends here.
This battle will be won.
They will not prevail.
This way.
Justice guides us.
I will not falter.
With precision.
Forge onward.
Ionia shall not fall.
I stand resolute.
Stay sharp.
True will cannot be defeated.
You rely on your weapons too much; try letting go!
Balance in all things.
My blade is not only precise, but totally gnarly.

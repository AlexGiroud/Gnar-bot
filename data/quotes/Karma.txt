Always trust your spirit.
None will question our resolve.
To conquer one's self is to conquer all.
Now we prove our courage.
There is wisdom in war.
Never become a monster to defeat one.
Ionia speaks through me.
Indecision is failure.
By force of will.
Act with conviction.
Peace, no matter the cost.
We must all make our choices.
Never again will I sit idle.
I have seen two paths and made another between.
My spirit is an unquenchable fire.
Heart and mind as one.
As Ionia changes, so must I.
Challenge what you know.
Never fear change.
The answer lies within.
We have learned as much as we have suffered.
I know your spirit, but I must stop your heart.
If you desire peace, you must prepare for war!
An ideal is nothing... until you fight for it.
You know what they say: Karma always catches up to you.
Peace!
Never falter.
Focus!
Lath Rian Oune Vi.
Gaen Na Kyri Vi.
Sae Eleisa Tera Vi.
Negotiations have ended.
They will not crush our spirit.
No compromise.
None will question our resolve.
Where the battle goes, so go I.
One by one, they will fall.
How noble.
Ionia shall prevail.
Focus your wit and will.
Victory is assured.
Peace begins within.
To conquer oneself, is to conquer all.
Hope is the greatest ally.
Together, we shall triumph.
Onward, always.
You should feel honored to face me.
I interrupted my meditation, for this?
This dress may have been impractical.
Guess what's about to hit the fan.
Lath Rian Oune Vi.
Gaen Na Kyri Vi.

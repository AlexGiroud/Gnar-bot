Into the fray!
Lead me to battle.
Into the fray!
Who's next?
Your time has come.
An eye for an eye.
Come here! I'll teach you all about the afterlife.
Are... you sure you're not in the wrong league?
Ugh, dust in the clockwork.
Let my blade speak the law!
Transcend imperfection.
To rebuild we must first destroy.
Faith and steel unbroken.
There will be no compromise.
This is for the greater good.
By wing and blade.
Order, through time and space.
A future forged in light and steel.
Everything in its place.
I bring a vision of utopia.
Perfection unto eternity.
Trust in my vision.
Prosperity through technology.
The whole world in our image.
Nothing left in flux.
Crafted in divine light.
I see into infinity.
In time, all will understand.
What? No! Ugh... Hmm. Sometimes you just need to reboot the system.
Uh, malfunction? What I... Uh, I mean... That was all part of the grand plan!
Uh, oh, ah, wha- wait. See? Perfection.
So long as I have my wings, you will always stand in my shadow.
The future is perfection. It's a pity you will not live to see it.
Forward!
Immortality!
Arise!
Undying!
Light protect you!

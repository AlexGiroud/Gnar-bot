Change... is good.
Isolate and devour.
One by one.
Ah... delicious.
Blood in the air.
Clever creatures.
They fear me.
Devour their bones.
Consume and adapt.
Position for ambush.
A different view.
I sense worthy prey.
Endless hunger.
This world is delicious!
Sharpening my claws.
Fear the Void.
No escape.
They'll never see me.
To truly know someone, eat them and walk a mile in their feet.
My purpose is eating deadly creatures. My hobby is eating Yordles.
I ate an optimist once, but I couldn't keep him down.
Do not fear death. The best part of you will live on!
If I eat you, will I learn how to die?
Hahaha. You're barely worth eating!
I am living change.
Evolve and overcome.
They can't keep up.
They will not expect this!
Limb from limb.
Ready to reap.
Slice them apart.
Death from afar.
Pierce and skewer.
Die running.
My wings are restless.
I will soar over them.
Strike from above.
They won't know what ate them.
In the shadows.
From the dark.
Isolate and devour.
One by one.
Ah... delicious.
Blood in the air.
Clever creatures.
They fear me.
Devour their bones.

Sharpening my claws.
Fear the Void.
No escape.

I have evolved beyond jokes. I am now a robot. Beep. Boop.

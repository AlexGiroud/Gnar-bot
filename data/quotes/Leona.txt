The dawn has arrived.
Twilight fades.
I will break their line.
They'll have to get through me.
Feel the sun's glory.
They will be sundered.
Stand and fight.
I will protect you.
First light approaches.
Rally to me.
The sun always rises.
Stay at the vanguard.
I must not fall.
Chosen of the sun.
Ever vigilant.
Next time, try to leave a dent.
Don't stare directly at me for too long.
I think I broke a nail, good thing it wasn't mine.

The day is upon us.
Chosen of the sun.
Ever vigilant.
Pen or sword - the shield is mightiest.
Next time, try to leave a dent.
Don't stare directly at me for too long.

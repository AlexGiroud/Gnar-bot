Tactical decision, summoner!
Illuminate the enemy!
Banish the shadows!
Light 'em up!
Focus on the battle.
With superior tactics.
I never think about losing.
I'll look into it.
Going!
I love it when a plan comes together.
Lighting the way.
We can do this.
Stay positive.
Bright decision!
With your power level, I suggest you forfeit instead.
In the name of Demacia, I will punish you!
Double rainbow? What does it mean...?
Well, a 'double rainbow' is a phenomenon of optics that displays a spectrum of light due to the sun shining on droplets of moisture in the atmosphere. Does that explain it?
Light mage? I'm just an ordinary mage.
Shhh! I'm charging my laser... 
Demacia!

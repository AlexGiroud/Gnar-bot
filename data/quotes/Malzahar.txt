Oblivion awaits!
It is done.
Mortality is weakness.
We demand sacrifice.
Inevitable.
Their time is short.
For the Void.
Icathia beckons.
As was foreseen.
In due course.
Second sight ordains it.
It is in motion.
At once.
We are timeless.
Do not challenge fate's will!
Without question.
Come mortal, witness your demise!
Bow to the void! Or be consumed by it!

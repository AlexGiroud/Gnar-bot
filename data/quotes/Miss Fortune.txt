Fortune doesn't favor fools!
The fun begins.
Nothing but powder monkeys.
I always shoot first.
No prey, no pay.
Guns blazin'.
Bang!
Step to.
Not a problem.
I know what I'm doing.
Set sail!
Sure you can handle me, summoner?
You've got dangerous eyes... I like that.
Don't get cocky.
I've got a good feeling about this.
Watch your mouth kid, or you'll find yourself respawning at home!
How do you like my guns... Shock, and Awe!

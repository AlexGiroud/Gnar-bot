I decide what the tide will bring.
They're puddle monsters at best.
Do not force my hand.
The seas are rising.
Wash them away.
Welcome to the deep end.
Water can heal - or harm.
Let the seas reclaim them.
Douse 'em.
Have a drink.
Soak it up.
This is minnow's play.
Bottom feeders.
The ocean will sweep them away.
The sea has no pity.
Quit flopping around.
There's always another wave.
Swim against the current.
I'll find my path.
Sure as the tides.
Great. More dry land.
We are all tied to the ocean.
Ride upon the waves.
Feet are strange.
People and their air...
The softest water wears down the hardest rock.
My people are counting on me.
I still hear the song of the sea.
I will see my home again.
My quest beckons.
Eww, whale breath.
Sometimes you're the catch. Sometimes you're the bait.
The sea holds fearsome creatures... and them.
I moonlight as a shark caller.
You're in over your head.
Afraid to get your feet wet?
Swim at your own risk.
Yeah!
Oceans spill forth!
High tide!

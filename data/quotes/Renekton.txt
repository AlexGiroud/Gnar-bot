As I live, all will die!
Cut them down!
Embrace the jaws of death.
I'll leave them in pieces.
Carnage!
Bask in their blood!
Light meat, dark meat, it's all the same.
There is no retreat.
Welcome the havoc.
Destruction approaches.
Lavish brutality.
Chaos will follow.
Who's next on the chopping block?
Nothing will stop me!
Nasus cannot escape me forever!
Come back when you've collected all the bits of yourself!
You should have done a better job locking me away, Nasus!
You are not my brother, traitor!
What? Do I have someone in my teeth?
Xerath, we will give them what they deserve.
Trapped in a box so long, Xerath! They never should have let us out!
Make this hurt.
They will feel pain they've never imagined.
No suffering is too great.
All will suffer as I have!
Now you will know agony!
I will spare no-one!
The slaughter will never end!
I will tear the world asunder!
Massacre them!
Shred their fragile bodies!
I will gut you all!
Oceans of blood!

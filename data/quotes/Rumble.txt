Knock me down, I'll get right back up.
I've got everyone's back.
Rev up and roll out!
Good guy? More like best</b> guy.
All you need is hope. And a giant metal suit.
My fuel is fighting spirit.
Set sights on the sky.
I'll show them what yordles are worth.
Heroes don't die; they're reborn as legends.
This is how a yordle rolls!
Too much is my middle name! That's right, I have two middle names.
They call me the Mighty Rumble. Maybe you've heard of me.
Nothing can stop me! Not even a wall of tigers with smaller tigers for teeth!

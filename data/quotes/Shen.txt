A demonstration of superior judgement.
It must be done.
Enforced equilibrium.
I find them unworthy.
Target marked.
With honor.
Understood.
With balanced steps.
Our wills align.
Press on.
From the shadows.
So I go.
Tread carefully.
Without a sound.
There is no dispute.
Immediately.
You're already dead, you just haven't caught up yet.
If light travels so fast, how come it's never caught a ninja?

Only you can hear me, Summoner. What masterpiece shall we play today?
Allegrissimo.
Order through music.
Brioso! Brioso!
Shall we resolve this dissonance?
The fanfare ascends.
A symphony of justice.
From my mind to yours.
Adagio, summoner.
Harmoniously.
Delicately.
With perfect tempo.
A sublime duet.
Quarter time!
Accurate, like a metronome.
Accelerated movement, I concur.
Just many of them.
Move like a metronome.
Here we go.
DJ Sona.
Adagio, summoner.
Remember, we are one.
Live for the moment.

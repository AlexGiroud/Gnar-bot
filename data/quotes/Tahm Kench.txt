Call me king, call me demon - water forgets the names of the drowned.
I see nothing splendiferous in this table's offerings!
It is my mouth into which all travels end.
Let us peruse this establishment's fare.
It is the heart from which the darkest water flows.
This buffet exceeds repugnance!
Does your establishment have</b> any tables?
How delectable.
Another meal.
Delicious.
Savor the misery.
An enticing culinary prospect.
New tastes.
I will consume all.
Something to nibble on.
A feast awaits.
Their despair... is the seasoning.
I must sample this buffet.
Another snack.
Yummy.
Might be savory.
Hunger!
Feed!
More!
Meat!
Dinner!
Fresh souls!
Mine!
My diet is expansively unique.
From suffering, my banquet is born.
Gluttony is impossible.
No true hunger can be abated.
To covet is to starve.
I have tastes that aren't easily... pacified.
Every heart has its own hunger.
All the world's a river - and I'm its king.
All creation is born famished and starving.
Everyone ends downriver... eventually.
Nothing escapes hunger.
I refuse to succumb to culinary degradation!
We all gourmandize from time to time.
The only real sin is to deny a craving.
Misery has a delectable taste.
Anything of depth is deceitful.
A depth of flavor is what I covet.
I am appetite focused.
True appetite never wanes.
All shall drown in my magnificence.
Let us eat voraciously and overindulge.
Now we shall gluttonize.
Every river ends in me!
A bargain is due!
The world is my feast!
Mercy has no flavor!
I am the River King!
The river never stops!
That aroma seduces...
Where is that taste?
Where is it!?
Hunger!
Give it to me!
I demand an entr√©e!
You are a malodorous offense to my palate!
The baseness of your appetite repulses me!
Your mind is as clear as mud.
Child, you're a couple cows short of a steak!
You're duller than a broken sandwich.
Travel awaits.
Step inside.
Closer.
Take the bargain.
This way!
Get inside!
Over here!
Come closer, child.
Vile!
Disgusting!
Nauseating!
Revolting!
Repugnant!
Unacceptable!
Needs salt!
You have succeeded only in ruffling my attire!
My constitution is unflappable!
Was that an attack, or an hors d'oeuvre?
How droll your attacks are!
Finally, my enormity matches my appetite.
A heart is so easily... eaten.
There is something sublime about holding a heart in your hand.
I can provide all manner of refuge.
I am sanctuary for those in my favour.
How did I leave my jacket pocket unadorned for so long?
I have a hunger for... fine shoes.
I wonder who might like to bargain for a little freedom.
I am an omen of voracity.
A little sedation for my more noisesome neighbours.
A handy tool for the next time I'm... in between meals.
Something about this blade feels... redundant.
I pity the hydra. So many heads intent on sharing the meal.
Truly this is the best way to enjoy a buffet.
My visage was already flawless, now it just has more vigor.
I refuse to trouble myself with charlatans.
Sorcery is a distasteful habit.
A gentleman without a cape is only half-dressed.
Fire warms the spirit, and charges the appetite.
War is an appetite like any other.
A hearty appetite pairs best with a robust constitution.
Say what you will - a large man can not</b> be ignored.
It is my will that matters. It is hunger that drives us all.
A shared will is a powerful thing.
This is my river, you scoundrel!
You dare invade my table?
Beast, you are a rank dish! Ill served!
I prefer to know when my next meal approaches.
Even when you have no bait, you can still cast a line and hope.
I search for bargains wherever fools cross my domain.
A true meal requires foresight to manifest.
Regrettably, I must retire in order to find a digestive.
I shall return to this establishment shortly.
I presume you are the waiter at this establishment.
Are you the waiter of this establishment?

Lady luck is smilin'.
Pick a card.
All or nothin'.
I never bluff.
Let's raise the stakes.
Looks like trouble.
Let it ride.
I got this.
Nobody touches the hat.
I reckon.
Doin' it.
Deal 'em.
It's all in the cards.
Just the luck of the draw.
It's my lucky day.
Don't mind if I do.
I'm one of a kind.
Always on the run.
Lookin' good.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Never lost a fair game... or played one.
Cheater's just a fancy word for winner.
Only two Jokers in the deck, and I get dealt you.
Only a fool plays the hand he's dealt.
√Åndale, heheheh...
Giddy up! Heheheh...
Feelin' blue.
Eyes open.
Clear as day.
Blood red.
Seein' red.
Thorned rose.
Shinin' gold.
Hold it, partner.
Lucky them.
No fightin' Destiny.
It ain't luck, it's Destiny.
I'm already gone.
I'm gone.
Gotta hit the trail.
Dead in his tracks.
Tough luck, Malcolm.
Simmer down, hotshot.
Pick a card.
Doin' it.
Deal 'em.
It's my lucky day.
I reckon.
It's all in the cards.
Just the luck of the draw.
I reckon.
It's all in the cards.
Just the luck of the draw.
Doin' it.
Deal 'em.
It's my lucky day.
The house always wins.
Only two jokers in the deck, and I get dealt you.

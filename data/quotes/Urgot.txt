Eternal life... endless torture.
Execute.
I detect the presence of scum.
Only I will remain.
They are condemned.
Must... punish.
Death is the only escape.
Destination received.
Cannot... rest.
Endless misery.
They will know fear.
The gift of eternal pain.
Systems ready.
The fortunate will be eradicated.
Existence is torment.
Hydraulics activated.
There's no coming back from your demise.
Fear? No... I am the mindkiller.
You can't beat me, so join me. I need a good pair of legs.

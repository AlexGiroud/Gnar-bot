The guilty will know agony.
No forgiveness.
They will know regret.
No turning back.
Face oblivion.
My arrows always find their marks.
Deliver them to their end.
Pity those who cross me.
Beware a man with nothing to lose.
My purpose is clear.
My work is not done.
I'm on borrowed time.
Give me a target.
I am forsaken.
Bloodshed carries a price.
Only cowards flee their fate.
There is no salvation.
I do what I must.
You'd like some real amusement? Come closer.
When you dance with death, lead.
Pain is my gift to you.
The cost of your life is one arrow.
No forgiveness.
They will know regret.
No turning back.
Face oblivion.
My arrows always find their marks.
Deliver them to their end.
Pity those who cross me.
Beware a man with nothing to lose.
My purpose is clear.
My work is not done.
I'm on borrowed time.
Give me a target.
I am forsaken.
Bloodshed carries a price.
Only cowards flee their fate.
There is no salvation.
I do what I must.
You'd like some real amusement? Come closer.
When you dance with death, lead.
Pain is my gift to you.

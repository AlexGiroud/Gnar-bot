Join the glorious evolution.
Inferior constructs.
They are obsolete.
Relinquish the flesh.
Destroy... then improve!
Their bodies are frail.
Adapt or be removed.
I am the first of many.
Metal is perfection.
With utmost efficiency.
Analyzing approach.
Embrace progress.
Pave the way.
Function over form.
All will soon change.
Submit to my designs.
Steel can fix all your flaws. (laughs)
My opponents need to be upgraded.
The key to the, uhh... huh? That is the, uhh... what? Urgh! Keep your hand to yourself!
Listen close- urgh, I have important- urgh! This is why I can't take you nice places!
Consume!
Obliterate!
Behold!
True power!

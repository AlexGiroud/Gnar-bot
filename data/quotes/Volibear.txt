Let the storm follow in my wake.
By Freljord's might.
I do not pity cowards.
Sniveling cubs!
Let none survive.
Tremble at my roar!
Is that a challenge?
To war!
Let the storm follow in my wake.
The thunder calls.
So it shall be.
Battle is in my blood.
Trust your instincts.
As fate decrees.
Strength and wisdom guide me.
The Ursine do not know fear.
A fool and his head are easily parted.
Hmm, I suppose you're expecting some unbearable pun.
Face the storm!
I have a special claw for you, Zilean.
Your time has run out, Chronokeeper.

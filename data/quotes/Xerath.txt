I will be free.
Simple fools.
Behold my power.
Primitive magic shall not best me.
Magic? I'll show you real</b> magic.
Flesh and blood; so fragile.
Sacrifices must be made.
I will unmake you.
Your demise beckons.
I will show you true power.
None will control me.
These chains cannot hold me.
I am eternal.
I will be their undoing.
The secrets of magic are mine alone.
I follow the path to power.
The affairs of mortals are beneath me.
The world may crumble, but I shall remain.
Emotions are only distractions.
Bound, but not broken.
I see the forces that hold the universe together.
I am the will of man unbound by flesh.
I stand at the brink of infinity.
You cannot fathom what I am.
It will take only a spark of my magic to end you.
You may stare, but your mind may collapse.
Azir, at long last, we will see what power you truly possess.
You are emperor of a wasteland, Azir.
Azir, the boy destined to chase the sun.
This time, Azir, I will need no surprise to topple you.
Nasus, the loyal pup, ever nipping at my heels.
Nasus... thank you for your brother.
You chase power, Syndra. I am power!
Those chains cannot hold me either, jailer.
Power, immortality, omniscience... but no leg room?!
Lightning bolt! Lightning bolt! Lightning bolt! Lightning bolt! Lightning bolt! Lightning bolt!
You shall bear witness to the only true ascended this day.
Mine is the only pure ascension.
Today, I will be free!
Ah! The energy courses through me!
Finally, I will show you what an ascended can do!
The ascension belongs to me!
The world forgot me. Now, they will remember!
We have the power! Now, strangle them with it!
It is our turn to punish the arrogant!
It is our time, crocodile, make them suffer.
Renekton, show them your hatred!
No-one will wrest ascension from me!
I was meant for ascension! See how I wield it!
Behold! My power is unmatched!
I will allow nothing to stand in my way!
Impostor!
Ascension never looked so good!
What a glorious being of pure energy!
True ascension is granted only to the worthy.
Who believes they have the strength to ascend?
I am power incarnate! Who dares oppose me?
Ascension is not granted, it is taken!
Only ten of you? How disappointing.
My will is law!
I will not be subverted!
You stand in the presence of a perfect being.
I will never concede the power I have taken!
You seek ascension. You will find failure.
I've waited a millennium for this!
Trapped for centuries, but I've still got it!
It's electric!
With ascension... comes killer moves!
Nobody puts Xerath in a sarcophagus! Nobody!
